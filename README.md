# Data Science Experiments  

This repository contains the set of experiments performed as part of the **Data Science** course. 
The primary objective of these experiments is to understand and implement various data science techniques, 
ranging from data preprocessing to machine learning model development and evaluation.  

## Repository Structure  

Each experiment is organized in a separate folder, containing the corresponding Jupyter Notebook.

## List of Experiments  

1. **Experiment 1:** To preprocess and prepare data using NumPy and Pandas in Python for effective analysis and modeling.

2. **Experiment 2:** To implement and evaluate Linear Regression for predictive modeling using Python, 
					and analyze the relationship between independent and dependent variables.
					
3. **Experiment 3:** To apply Logistic Regression for binary classification problems using machine learning, 
					and assess model performance through appropriate evaluation metrics.
					
4. **Experiment 4:** To implement Decision Tree classifier models to perform supervised classification and evaluate model performance.

5. **Experiment 5:** To develop and evaluate logistic regression models for multi-class classification tasks using machine learning. 

*(More experiments will be added as we proceed further during this course.)*  

## Software and Tools Used  

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Development Environment:** Google Colab  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
