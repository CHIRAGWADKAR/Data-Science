# Data Science Experiments

This repository contains the set of experiments performed as part of the **Data Science** course.
The primary objective of these experiments is to understand and implement various data science techniques,
ranging from data preprocessing to machine learning model development and evaluation.

## Repository Structure

Each experiment is organized in a separate folder, containing the corresponding Jupyter Notebook.

## List of Experiments

**Experiment 1:** To preprocess and prepare data using NumPy and Pandas in Python for effective analysis and modeling.

**Experiment 2:** To implement and evaluate Linear Regression for predictive modeling using Python,
   and analyze the relationship between independent and dependent variables.
   
**Experiment 3:** To apply Logistic Regression for binary classification problems using machine learning,
   and assess model performance through appropriate evaluation metrics.
**Experiment 4:** To implement Decision Tree classifier models to perform supervised classification and evaluate model performance.

**Experiment 5:** To develop and evaluate logistic regression models for multi-class classification tasks using machine learning.

**Experiment 6:** To apply the Naive Bayes machine learning algorithm for classification tasks and assess accuracy, precision, and recall.

_(More experiments will be added as we proceed further during this course.)_
